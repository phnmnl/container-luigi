Version: 2.6.0

## Short Description

Luigi is a Python (2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5) package that helps you build complex pipelines of batch jobs. It handles dependency resolution, workflow management, visualization, handling failures, command line integration, and much more.

## Description

This container is built on top of `python:alpine` and its only aim is to run the [Luigi central scheduler](http://luigi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/central_scheduler.html).
